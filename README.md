# Pharmacy-Access
A student project to create a fully fledged Pharmacy with the ability to edit all aspects of it, from adding to the database of patients and doctors to completing orders for drugs and dispatching.


After firing up the program, the main menu turns on, where we can freely navigate and go to the next tabs.

Forms:
Doctors - a list of doctors entered in the database with the possibility of adding more.
Drugs - a list of drugs entered in the database with the possibility of adding more.
Patients - a list of patients entered in the database with the possibility of adding more.
Prescriptions - a list of prescriptions entered in the database with the possibility of adding more.
Orders - a list of orders entered in the database with the possibility of adding more.

Reports - a list of all Patients, Doctors, Medications, Employees, Prescriptions, Orders and many more.

The project will also take into account Queries, which consist, for example, in searching for drugs in which prescriptions are located.
